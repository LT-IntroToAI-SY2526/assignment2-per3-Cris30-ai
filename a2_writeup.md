## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The most difficult thing for me while completing the match function was understand what the % symbol meant. After trial and error I finally discovered that the % symbol is used to match words from the source. When discovering % function I was able to complete the code. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
